## Introduction
This app was created to tackle one of the business challenges issued by Singapore Airlines (SIA) during the SIA App Challenge 2017: Cargo Shipment Management. The challenge is to create a software that can measure the dimensions of cargos and objects without any special equipment. More information about the challenge can be found [here](http://appchallenge.singaporeair.com/SQ-App-Challenge-2017-Business-Challenges.pdf) 

## How does it work?
This app uses trigonometry to measure the object. 

## Accuracy
As per our estimate, the result is about +/- 5cm away from the actual dimensions. The main cause for inaccuracy is caused by unsteady hand as it would affect the sensors' readings.
