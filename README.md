## Introduction
This app was created to tackle one of the business challenges issued by Singapore Airlines (SIA) during the SIA App Challenge 2017: Cargo Shipment Management. The challenge is to create a software that can measure the dimensions of cargos and objects without any special equipment. More information about the challenge can be found [here](http://appchallenge.singaporeair.com/SQ-App-Challenge-2017-Business-Challenges.pdf) 

## How does it work?
This app uses math and trigonometry to measure the object. To measure, simply follow the instructions on the app. The app utilises position sensors to do the measurement, so if your phone does not have the sensors, this app will NOT work. 

## Accuracy
As per our estimate, the result is about +/- 5cm away from the actual dimensions. Any cause for inaccuracy is due to unsteady hand as it would affect the position sensors' readings.
